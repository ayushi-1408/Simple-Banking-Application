 In this project, I have learnt how to take input from the user using Scanner class, basics about String, how to print in java, variables, if/else statements, methods, loops, etc. In simple banking application I will be coding the simple bank operations like check balance, deposit, withdraw, exit, etc. This is one of the easiest projects to start with for beginners.
